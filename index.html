					   I hold a 2019 <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt">PhD in Mathematical Sciences</span> from Clemson University,
					   with an emphasis in Statistics. My professional hobbies include coding, modeling, and analyzing
					   complex datasets. Although I apply my current <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt">data science</span>
					   skills to solve real-world problems, I find enjoyment in staying current in academic literature,
					   often coding and deriving novel published techniques from scratch. Currently, I am deep diving
					   into <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt">machine learning</span> techniques, particularly neural
					   networks and their different frameworks like regular feed-forward, CNNs, RNNs, and transformers.

					<ul>
						<li>
							<span>
							Developed a tree-based <b>recommender model</b> informed by internal and external data (CDC and epidemiological
						    studies) which resulted in over 42% of the member base being targeted by marketing outreaches. This model
						    has also been integrated in other areas of the business and won the Teladoc Health Innovation Award for its
						    proven impact on the business.
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
 							Developed an <b>XGBoost model</b> to score members based on their propensity to engage with the expert medical
							opinion service. The model was built on historical campaign data which resulted in more than 50% lift in
							conversion rates when targeting top deciles, aligning with the companyâ€™s campaign optimization efforts in
							improving ROI metrics. The model is used for each quarterly expert medical opinion campaign
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							Developed machine learning <b>propensity models</b> to continually
							score members based on their likelihood to
						    respond to marketing channels or engage in certain products. Model performance is measured through outcome
							driven metrics such as accuracy, recall, or precision and is monitored quarterly to guide timely model retuning.
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							Developed a <b>Markov chain</b> expected return time framework to guide timely communications for members who
							deviate from their normal account activity. This replaced a fixed 10-day inactivity flag with a model-based
							approach that dynamically estimates a member's normal patterns, lowering the risk of member churn.
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							Built and conducted statistically sound <b>experimental designs</b> to gather member behavioral data. This insight
							is useful for recommending member personalization and engagement initiatives to marketing partners in an
							effort to increase member engagement and return on investment (ROI).
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							Contribute to and maintain a large scale data science <b>GitHub</b> repository which houses a suite of registered
							models, database connections, and databricks notebooks used organization wide.
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							<b>Software</b>: Python, PySpark, Databricks, GitHub, AWS, Delta Lake, SQL, etc.

					<i>Assistance Vice President</i> (Sep 2021 &#8212; Apr 2022)
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span>
							Developed quantitative <b>volume forecasting</b> models for the Bank'~s capacity and strategic workforce planning in
							the First Mortgage and Home Equity loans space.
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							Led the <b>automation and standardization</b> of volume forecast modeling to be used organization wide, which
							reduced model development time by over 50% and eliminated error-prone manual processing.
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							 Collaborated with <b>business leaders</b> to enhance the forecasting of volumes based on historical trends and changes
							 in business processes.
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							Presented quarterly volume forecasts to business executives and <b>finance partners</b> for approval.

						<li>
							<span>
							<b>Software</b>: Python, SAS, GitHub, Excel, etc.

					<i>Assistance Vice President</i> (Oct 2019 &#8212; Sep 2021)
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span>
							Led the redevelopment of the defaults and ratings transition model, one of the largest and <b>high-risk models</b>
							for the Bank's commercial and industrial portfolio. The model outputs point-in-time quarterly transition
							matrices used for CCAR, CECL, and IFRS 9 reporting.
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							Developed, implemented, and documented various <b>sensitivity tests</b> to assess potential <b>operational risks</b> in
							the modeling framework. Testing involved derivation and implementation of the least absolute shrinkage
							and selection operator (LASSO) for variable selection and incorporating constrained maximum-likelihood
							estimation to increase model output granularity for more precise modeling.
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							Contributed to a large scale collaborative model code repository using <b>version control</b> software and wrote
							unit tests to ensure code changes adhere to expected output. This code base is used across the Bank's
							risk modeling organization.
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							Improved <b>model accuracy</b> and flexibility by incorporating industry specific macrovariables not previously
							considered in the modeling framework. This was a step forward in the Bank's efforts to climate risk
							modeling and allowing more accurate stress forecasts as industries are affected differently during stress.
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							Performed data assessment and <b>variable selection</b> using likelihood ratio test, Wald test, and backward
							stagewise selection. Model explanatory power was demonstrated through default, downgrade, and upgrade
							rate backtesting and various goodness-of-fit metrics such as AUC and RMSE.
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							Presented model forecasts to <b>business stakeholders</b> and communicated material model updates that drove
							changes in expected credit losses.
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							Accepted model hand-off halfway through model redevelopment for the <b>probability of default</b> (PD) component.
							The model is developed to be compliant with the Third Basel Accord (Basel III) for the Bank's
							risk weighted asset (RWA) and economic capital (EC) planning.
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							Documented the PD model's redevelopment and communicated the updates to business stakeholders and
							<b>model validators</b> for a successful validation.
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							Performed COVID-19 impact analysis to understand model implications and to <b>defend the model</b> was fit
							for use during the pandemic.

						<li>
							<span>
							<b>Software</b>: Python, Linux, GitHub, SQL, Excel, etc.
